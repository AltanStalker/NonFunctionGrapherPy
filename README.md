NonFunctionGrapherPy
====================
This is a port to Python of zdizzler's project. That can be found here: https://github.com/zdizzler/Non-Function-Grapher

Graphs systems of equations that would normally be hard to visualize

Requires either the Myro Graphics library or the Calico IDE (in which that's included)
